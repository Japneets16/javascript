// it is used to  make the strings in the more easy way ( ${name})

// Absolutely! In simple terms, a template literal in JavaScript is a way to write strings that allows you to easily include variables and expressions inside the string.

// Instead of using single or double quotes, you use backticks (` `) to enclose the string. Inside this string, you can use ${} to insert variables or expressions. This makes it simpler and more readable compared to traditional string concatenation.

let namee="jp"
let age=20;

// console.log("the name of the person is :", namee)
// console.log("the age is ",age , "of that person") 

// to write them in more easy way

console.log(`hlo my name is ${namee} and my age is ${age}`)
