// it is used to delay the execution of the piece of code 

function greet(){
    alert("main hun paapi")
}

setTimeout(greet,3000);       
//the time is in the milliseconds and there will be the execution of the code after the given time it is 



// easy explanation of the set timeout:

// Imagine you're in a kitchen, and you're waiting for your toaster to finish toasting bread. You set a timer to remind you to check the toaster after 5 minutes.

// Simulating a timer for checking the toaster

// setTimeout(function() {
//     console.log("Check the toaster! Your toast may be ready.");
// }, 300000); // 300000 milliseconds = 5 minutes

// In this example, the message "Check the toaster! Your toast may be ready." will appear in the console after 5 minutes.
